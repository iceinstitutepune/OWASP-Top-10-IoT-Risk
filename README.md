# OWASP Top 10 IoT Risks Lab üîêüì°

This repository contains a **software-only lab environment** designed to help students and professionals understand and practically demonstrate the **OWASP Top 10 IoT Security Risks**. Built using Python (Flask), Mosquitto MQTT, and other open-source tools, this lab simulates real-world vulnerabilities found in IoT systems‚Äîwithout requiring any physical IoT hardware.

## üß™ What‚Äôs Inside?

The lab includes simulated components (devices, APIs, services) for the following OWASP IoT risks:

| Risk ID | OWASP Risk Description                                 |
|--------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| I1      | Weak, Guessable, or Hardcoded Passwords                |
| I2      | Insecure Network Services                              |
| I3      | Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces                          |
| I4      | Lack of Secure Update Mechanism                        |
| I5      | Use of Insecure or Outdated Components                 |
| I6      | Insufficient Privacy Protection                        |
| I7      | Insecure Data Transfer and Storage                     |
| I8      | Lack of Device Management                              |
| I9      | Insecure Default Settings                              |
